# 🛑 STOP AND READ

## I cannot finish the deployment because I cannot type your password.

You must run this command in your terminal **yourself**:

```bash
git push origin master
```

### Why?
1. GitHub requires a password/token to accept code.
2. I am an AI - I cannot see or type into your password prompt.
3. **Your code is ready**, but it is stuck on your computer.

### What to do:
1. Open your terminal (where you run commands).
2. Type: `git push origin master`
3. Press Enter.
4. Enter your Username (`Srujan0798`) and Password/Token when asked.

**Once you do this, tell me "Done" and I will help you deploy.**
